In some cases this is undesirable because it means that a proration charge will be applied on first billing to line up the cycles.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION - this alignment will cause the subscriptions bill cycle to line up with the first bill day of the subscription plan. So, if the subscription starts on January 3rd and has a 15 day free trial, the first billed day with be January 18th and the bill cycle day for the subscription will be set to 18.<br><br>BUNDLE - setting the alignment to bundle is useful for add-ons because it sets the bill cycle day to be aligned with whatever the base plan is using.",

This is for instance useful if you want to allow add-on trials during the trial phase of the base plan only. The addon plans must have a trial of the same length as the base plan and then the trials will expire at the same time whenever the add-on is created.<br><br>START_OF_SUBSCRIPTION - this causes the phases of the add-on to start when the add-on subscription is created. This is for instance useful if you want to allow add-ons to have trials that are occur independently of the base plan.",

This is the most common alignment and applies in most situations.<br><br>START_OF_BUNDLE - The plan phases should align with the start of the base subscription.
